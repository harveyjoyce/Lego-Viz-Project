# LEGO Visualization Project

A SQL Portfolio challenge, create a schema, analyse data, create a visualisation.

# üÖ∞Ô∏è About

The LEGO Visualization Project aimed to explore and analyze the intricate world of LEGO sets using SQL and Snowflake for data management, analysis, and visualization. Through this project, I delved into the dataset to investigate various aspects of LEGO sets, including unique parts, set compositions, and trends over time.

The LEGO Visualization Project deepened my understanding of LEGO sets and their ecosystem. Analyzing data and creating visualizations highlighted the creativity and diversity of the LEGO brand. This project also enhanced my SQL, data management, and visualization skills, providing valuable tools for future data-driven projects. Overall, it was a fascinating exploration of the intersection between data science and one of the world's most cherished toys!

# üõ¢Ô∏è Data Sources

# Deliverables:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ A schema in the TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS database with tables populated with LEGO data.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ A SQL script creating the schema, tables, inserting data, and defining primary and foreign keys.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ A DBeaver ER diagram showing table relationships.

## Created Schema:

I created a schema within the TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS database.


  CREATED SCHEMA TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS.STAGING;

## Created Tables:

I created tables based on existing data: COLORS, INVENTORIES, INVENTORY_PARTS, INVENTORY_SETS, PARTS, PART_CATEGORIES, SETS, THEMES.


  CREATED TABLE TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS.STAGING.COLORS (
    -- Defined columns and data types
  );
  -- Repeated for other tables

## Inserted Data:

I populated tables with data from the corresponding tables in the STAGING schema.


  INSERTED INTO TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS.STAGING.COLORS (
    SELECT *
    FROM TIL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS.STAGING.LEGO_COLORS
  );
  -- Repeated for other tables

## Set Primary and Foreign Keys:

I defined primary and foreign keys for each table.

  ALTERED TABLE table_name ADDED PRIMARY KEY (column_name);
  ALTERED TABLE table_name ADDED FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES another_table(another_tables_primary_key_column);

## Created ER Diagram:

I downloaded DBeaver and created an ER diagram to visualize table relationships.

# ü™Ñ Data Reshape

# Deliverables:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identified Unique Parts: I identified parts that appeared in only one LEGO set.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzed Sets: I calculated the number of unique parts and total parts for each LEGO set. I calculated the ratio of unique parts to total parts.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Created a View: I created a view containing set name, year of release, theme, number of unique parts, total number of parts, and uniqueness ratio.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Downloaded Data: I extracted data from the view and saved it locally as a CSV file.


# üìà Charting in Tableau

# Deliverables:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ I built a Tableau dashboard to explore unique parts in LEGO sets:

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ I connected to Snowflake and the view created in Part 2.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ I created three charts exploring unique LEGO parts: Change over time, Compared to the total parts in a set, By set theme.


I also added titles, tooltips and interactions to the visualization. A user is able to filter a particular year or specific uniqueness ratio!

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next steps

Some areas that might improve this work could include:

- Incorporating sales data to answer the question "do sets with more unique parts sell better?"
- Incorporating colour data to look at how coloured parts have evolved over time.
